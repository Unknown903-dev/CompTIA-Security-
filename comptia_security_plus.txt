        Confidentiality
                - Ensures that unauthorized users cannot access sensitive data or information from an application or system
                - Often achieved using techniques like cryptography to ensure only authorized users can view the data
                - Encompasses maintaining access restrictions on information, including data in transit, at rest, and in use
                - Essential for protecting personal privacy and confidential information, such as passwords, cryptographic keys, PII (Personally Identifiable Information), PHI (Personal Health Information), IP (Intellectual Property), and other sensitive data
                        Examples of confidentiality measures include:
                                - Utilizing IPsec Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
                                - Employing mutual TLS (Transport Layer Security) between a browser and server
                                - Storing sensitive data in secure partitions or enclaves on mobile devices
                                - Applying AES encryption to data at rest, such as files, databases, or storage objects

        Integrity
                - Focuses on preventing unauthorized alteration or destruction of information
                - Ensures that data remains accurate and unmodified without proper authorization
                - Integrity reflects:
                        - The operating system’s logical reliability
                        - The software and hardware’s consistency in maintaining protection mechanisms
                        - The correctness of data structures and the integrity of stored data
                        Examples of integrity measures:
                                - Using checksums when transferring files between volumes
                                - Performing frame check sequences in Ethernet frames
                                - Applying hashed message authentication codes (HMACs) to advertisements between routers
                                - Implementing mandatory access control techniques like Biba or Clark-Wilson

        Availability
                - Ensures that information and systems are accessible and usable by authorized individuals when needed
                - A system property ensuring reliable access to data and services
                - Aims for “high availability,” ensuring services remain operational during both planned and unplanned outages
                        Examples of availability measures:
                                - Deploying protections against spoofing, flooding, DDOS, and poisoning to ensure data can be accessed
                                - Ensuring critical security tools like firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and antivirus are always operational, often within failover groups
                                - Selecting optimal disaster recovery solutions tailored to the organization’s needs
in other words 
	data must be kept confidential 
	data must be accurate (data integrity)
	data must be available when requested
-----------------------
        Non-Repudiation
                - Prevents a subject from denying their involvement in a digital transaction, such as an email or contract
                - Guarantees that once an agreement is made, the subject cannot refute responsibility
                - For example, a pen signature on a contract ensures non-repudiation
                - In IT, this is often achieved using public/private key pairs and digitally signed certificates for both sending and receiving parties
                - Without non-repudiation, a sender may later claim they did not perform a specific action (like an online banking transaction), but their private key signing the cryptographic hash ensures accountability

        Triple (AAA): Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
                - Authentication: Verifying the identity of an entity (user, application, or system)
                - Authorization: Determining what actions the authenticated entity can perform or which resources they can access
                - Accounting: Tracking the entity’s activities, such as when they started, ended, and the duration of their actions

                In AAA services, distinguishing between character mode and packet mode is important:
                - Character mode: Used when sending commands or keystrokes directly to a network access device (e.g., a router or firewall) for configuration purposes
                - Packet mode: Used when the network device acts as an authentication proxy, authenticating on behalf of other network services or systems (like web servers, FTP servers, etc)

                AAA in action:
                - Character Mode: Admin access to a network device for configuration
                - Packet Mode: Accessing resources in a public zone (e.g., a web server) through a network device performing packet-level AAA

                - Authentication must occur even in open or anonymous access techniques, such as 802.11 wireless or anonymous FTP
                - Authorization: Although optional for authenticated entities, it’s often critical from a policy standpoint to restrict access
                - Accounting: Mainly used for monitoring activities and generating reports, or for billing and chargeback purposes
                - RADIUS and DIAMETER are popular AAA protocols, with DIAMETER being the next-generation version

        Authenticating People
                - Authentication verifies that the individual is indeed who they claim to be
                - The most common authentication factors are something you know (like a password), something you have (like a smart card), or something you are (like biometric traits)
                        Examples of authentication methods:
                                - Username and password or passphrase
                                - Personal Identification Number (PIN)
                                - Smart card or USB token
                                - X.509 v3 digital certificate
                                - Biometric factors such as fingerprints, retina scans, or face recognition

        Authenticating Devices and Systems
                - Devices, referred to as “non-person entities” (NPEs), can also be authenticated to ensure they are authorized to connect to networks or systems
                - Common device authentication methods:
                        - Shared secret keys
                        - X.509 v3 certificates stored in software applications
                        - Cryptographic keys in hardware like a TPM or HSM
                        - Protected access files (PACs) in wireless infrastructures
                - The increasing role of endpoint security, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, highlights the need for device authentication

        Authorization Models
                - DAC (Discretionary Access Control): Access decisions are made by resource owners. While flexible, DAC can lead to inconsistent access controls without proper automation and visibility.
                - RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Access is granted based on predefined roles associated with a user’s job title or position.
                        - Roles determine permissions, and users inherit those permissions. Common in systems like hospitals or databases
                - MAC (Mandatory Access Control): A rigid model where access is determined by the system based on security labels and clearance levels. Common in high-security environments
                - ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control): Access decisions are based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment
                - ABDAC (Attribute-Based Dynamic Access Control): Combines ABAC with dynamic factors such as risk assessment, contextual information, or user behavior analytics
                - Rule-Based Access Control: Rules define conditions for granting access based on factors like IP address, protocol, or service

        Security Control Categories
                - Technical Controls: Automated mechanisms that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability protections, including encryption, SIEM systems, and IAM tools
                - Managerial Controls: Policies and procedures governing security, such as acceptable use policies, training programs, and risk assessments
                - Operational Controls: Day-to-day activities that maintain security, such as patch management, incident response, and system monitoring
                - Physical Controls: Protect physical access to systems, facilities, and people. Includes barriers, surveillance, locks, and environmental controls
make sure to memorize the categories


control types: preventative, deterrent, the detective, corrective, compensating, and directive
	
	- Preventative attacks stop an attacker from successfully conducting an exploit or advanced persistent threat
 		for ex: fences, gates, and locking mechanisms. And although a fence or a gate or even a lock can be overcome by brute force, we still consider them preventative

	- Deterrent controls are designed to discourage an attacker from starting or continuing an attack
		for Ex: warning signs, bollards, window stickers, or the visible presence of security guard
	
	- Detective controls are used to identify when an attack is occurring and to observe the stages of the attacker’s kill chain that is, the sequence of actions an attacker takes against a system
		
	- An intrusion detection system can be technical, such as an IDS or IPS sensor, or physical, such as a surveillance camera or other monitoring system

	- Corrective controls are used to restore a system to its state prior to a negative event
	 This restoration point is known as the recovery point or recovery point objective (RPO), and these controls are intended to fix or correct an identified issue
		 For ex: after a ransomware attack, you can reimage the machine and recover the data from a backup
	
	- A compensating control aids control that are already in place, or it's to provide a temporary stopgap solution
		for ex: it could be a next-generation endpoint protection system such as Palo Alto Cortex XDR, or it could be some stopgap measure that you put in place 
		until you have the full budget for a comprehensive solution
	
	- A directive control is basically mandatory policies and regulations that are in place to maintain consistency and compliance
		For ex: a directive that states how an end user can use their provisioned pad or mobile device, or company car or truck
